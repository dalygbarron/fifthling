yeah I have decided to kind of remove the scene system actually. We will just
use globals for game global state.

Done well, it doesn't add confusion really, the only problem that seems like a
real thing rather than a stack overflow induced ghost vision is that saving and
loading have to be tested carefully to make sure state doesn't leak between
games or get lost. Main points to deal with that are:
 - keep global state centralised in a few objects so it's harder to forget
   about something.
 - Ideally figure out a way of doing some kind of automatic testing that can
   identify state leakage or lost state. Maybe we could hash the global game
   state? that assumes we remember to put everything into the hash as well tho.

Ok so as well as relying on global state, this now means that basically
everything that happens in the game counts as a kind of level or something that
happens in it.
So the level needs to have a quite robust state machine thing to handle the
different things you can be doing in it, but it needed that already so it
shouldn't be too big of a deal. Some states like say for example rendering a
settings menu will likely use completely different code but many will be doing
similar things.

Also, I want to make it that each "map" is an overlay that gets loaded into
memory and dynamically linked when you go to it.
