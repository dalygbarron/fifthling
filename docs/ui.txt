Yeah just thinking about what we need in the base game...

we have the text box down the bottom and the map next to it. Neither of those
are interactive so they hardly even count as UI, but then you have also got
things like the inventory and interacting with characters.

I'd kind of be inclined to just implement them as seperate things and simply
have some functions for rendering boxes etc in common.

We are going to need some kind of scene stack system though so we can have the
inventory window appear on top and let us pick an item etc.

Yep OK, so we are doing the old scene stack. Lets think about how that is going
to work in C.
