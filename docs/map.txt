Ok, so we have got some rudiments of a level screen, but how does the game
keep track of where you are and what other levels you can travel to?

I guess we can have a map of all the levels that are connected to one another
with a linked list type of thing. Some levels are not connected though so they
will probably be stored in a different file or whatever.

I guess we can have some sort of addressing system that looks like
"map-file.ext:level" for when you want to send the player to a level outside
of the current map. Also keep in mind sometimes a new path can be opened in the
existing map but we can figure that out later I think.

yeah ok so we have this map file which stores a whole heap of levels. Format
doesn't matter much, can use whatever seems pertinent, but more importantly,
how are we going to create this file? There's too much stuff in these to not
have some kind of editor, which I guess means I am going to have to create one.
Not super keen about that but oh well.

For each individual level, it needs to be able to set the background image, an
optional name, place entities that are in it by default, set some config on
them, and it needs to set what exits it has, and also how many enemies it can
have in it at the same time.

The exits that exist on each level are then used to construct a graph of the
overall map, and then you can traverse to the other maps to set them up etc.

That's a lot of stuff and not all of it is very well defined right now, so lets
see if we can think of an MVP that is easy to adapt into the full banana....
 - create a map, it starts with a level in the center.
 - set background, size, orientation, description, and exits.
 - be able to look at graph thing and select levels to edit etc.
 - save to a format the N64 can read.

I don't reckon we are gonna be able to do a full on "load it straight from disk
into a struct with no diversions" type of deal but we can
